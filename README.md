# M-code overlay linker

This is mcl, an M-Code linker that supports overlays.

Please be aware that this is code developed for temporary use in
August 1983. It depends on a K&R compiler. This was developed and
run on a Perkin-Elmer 3220 architecture running Unix Edition VII. It
is recommended to compile and run this on an emulator of the ancient
architecture this utility was developed on.
